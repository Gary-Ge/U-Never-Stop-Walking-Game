# U-Never-Stop-Walking-Game
The game:U Never Stop Walking which has FPS and VR version was created byTeam Elevencent 2022

In this project, we aimed to develop an action-adventure platform titled “yoU Never Stop Walking”, which is set in a combination of a futuristic UNSW campus and a Cyberpunk city environment. The game is a mixture of parkour and combat, which allows the players to explore the world and fight enemies while climbing, sprinting, and vaulting around the environment. Within this 3D/Virtual World game, players step into the role of the main protagonist who is skilled in parkour and shooting, and undertake a series of missions to save UNSW when a viral outbreak has turned most of the campus into mindless zombie-like creatures.
